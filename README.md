<h1>Best Business Recommendation</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM) is a company that specializes in healthy, gourmet quality meals freshly fixed in containers. Products are marketed and sold at high-end grocery stores in five locations (Berkeley, CA; Dallas, TX; Miami, Fl; Nashville, TN; and Seattle, WA).</p>

<p>Meals are sold at a flat rate of twelve dollars per meal with no minimum. Since the food has to be heated before eating, it is not subject to sales tax. Customers must order by 10 AM one day in order to pick up the meals the next day.</p>

<p>AGM has just finished a very successful year on the enhanced computer systems, and now has a database of sales data for one year.</p>

<p>Using this context and data stored in a PostgreSQL database, exploratory analyses were performed to determine the best recommendation and the impact of holidays on sales.</p>
